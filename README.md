# shortest_path_app
Find the shortest walking path between two locations on the UW-Madison campus using Dijkstra's algorithm

<br>

_Functionality_ 

Read in a dataset of walking-time between many sets of buildings. Store these as nodes (buildings) and edges (weight = walking time) in an undirected graph. Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between two points with the smallest possible computing time-complexity. Once the user enters start and end points, output the list of buildings passed on the minimum-walking-time path between the two buildings. 

_Reason to use_

Find the shortest walking path from one building to another on the UW-Madison 

_How to use_

From the terminal, navigate to the output folder, and then enter in the terminal:
<br>
java ShortestPathApp
<br>
Use the menu options to display a list of buildings, then enter buildings as start and end points.
